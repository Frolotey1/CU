# Console Utility
This is the simple version of the console utility with simple commands. It was written on `Java` and includes supporting of the two languages: `Deutsch` and `English`.
# Java 
Java like language was used for creation of this project. The Java's version is `23`. ConsoleUtility supports all Java's versions after Java `10/11` and newer. 
# Command Lines 
ConsoleUtility can work in `Windows PowerShell` in Windows and the `bash-line` in Linux. 
# Compiler for Java 
For starting of this project you must have java compiler or `javac`. In Windows this compiler added automatically when you use the `Intellig Idea IDE`. In Linux System if you don't have the default-jdk packet, so you need to import it in your bash-line and your distrib which you use. You can easy install default-jdk packet using: `sudo apt install default-jdk` (example for Ubuntu distrib in Linux)
# How start the project? 
You must download from this repository `CU` like file and put it after `C:\` path in Windows PowerShell or `/home/` path in Bash-Line in Linux 

*(Advice: use set-location like command in Windows PowerShell for the changing path (for Windows). In the Linux system you can use cd to this repositories's directory and cd - for comeback to past catalog, to home).*

And path will changing on ``C:\CU-ConsoleUtility`` (in Windows). In the Linux System, in Bash-Line: `/home/CU-ConsoleUtility`. After `C:\CU-ConsoleUtility` you must write: `java src/com/console/application/Main.java`. In Bash-Line n Linux after `/home/CU-ConsoleUtility`: `java src\com\console\application\Main.java`. This command will start the ConsoleUtility and you need to register in the ConsoleUtility **(WARNING: The PasswordManagering in this project is simple and uses the txt file of the programm. This is the training manual)**. After register or login (if you had the password earlier) you can select one language for working: Deutsch or English. After selecting programm'll give you the path to the correct version of the ConsoleUtility: `src/ConsoleUtilityItself.java` (English) or `src/KonsoleDienstProgramm.java` (Deutsch). Also there will written the advice for familiarization with commands of the concret utility: 
1. `--help, --hp.` (English Console Utility) or `--helfen, --hel` (Deutsch Konsole Dienst Programm)
2. `--search, --sh.` (English Console Utility) or `--suchen, --sun` (Deutsch Konsole Dienst Programm)
3. when you don't write not any command utility will show you the list of commands for working with utility. This is the prompt.
 
And for familiarization with syntax of tthe commands you can use `--tldr` or `--tl` commands.
